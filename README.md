# Speed Test 

This is a simple speed test website that allows users to test their internet download speed using a backend server. The project serves a large file (10MB) from the server, measures the time it takes to download, and calculates the internet speed in Mbps (megabits per second).

## Features

- Backend server using Node.js and Express to serve a test file for download.
- Frontend displays the real-time download speed, similar to popular speed test websites.
- Displays download speed in Mbps.
- Uses a simple UI built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
- **File Serving**: Express `res.download()` to serve a test file for speed measurement
- **Speed Calculation**: Measures download time to calculate speed in Mbps.
